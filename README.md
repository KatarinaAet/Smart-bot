It is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot].

### Running Bot Locally

Firstly, you need to have [NodeJs] and [npm] installed.

[NodeJs]: https://nodejs.org/en/
[npm]: https://nodejs.org/en/

You can start Bot locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    Risky-Bot>

Then you can interact with Risky-Bot by typing `/help`.

    Risky-Bot> /help

### Scripting

"Brains" of Bot are included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to
get started, along with the [Scripting Guide][scripting-docs].

## Adapters

Adapters are the interface to the service you want your hubot to run on, such
as Campfire or IRC. There are a number of third party adapters that the
community have contributed.

If you would like to run a non-Campfire or shell adapter you will need to add
the adapter package as a dependency to the `package.json` file in the
`dependencies` section.

Once you've added the dependency with `npm install --save` to install it you
can then run hubot with the adapter.

    % bin/hubot -a <adapter>

Where `<adapter>` is the name of your adapter without the `hubot-` prefix.

In this project I used [hubot-symphony] adapter. Before start working with it,
you also have to export some environment vars, such as SYMPHONY_HOST, SYMPHONY_PRIVATE_KEY, etc.
